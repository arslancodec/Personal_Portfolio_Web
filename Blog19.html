        <h2>Understanding Market Basket Analysis</h2>
        <p>Market Basket Analysis is based on association rule mining, where frequent patterns are extracted from transaction data. It identifies product combinations that often appear together in shopping carts, leading to strategic marketing and inventory management decisions.</p>

        <h2>Key Concepts in Market Basket Analysis</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Support</h3>
        <p>Support measures how frequently an itemset appears in the dataset. Higher support values indicate that the itemset is common in transactions.</p>

        <h3>2. Confidence</h3>
        <p>Confidence calculates how often a rule holds true. For example, if "bread â†’ butter" has a confidence of 80%, it means that 80% of transactions containing bread also include butter.</p>

        <h3>3. Lift</h3>
        <p>Lift measures the strength of an association rule compared to random chance. A lift value greater than 1 indicates a strong relationship between items.</p>

        <h2>Real-World Applications of Market Basket Analysis</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Retail and E-commerce</h3>
        <p>Retailers use MBA to optimize product placement, recommend complementary products, and create effective promotional campaigns. For example, online stores suggest "Frequently Bought Together" items based on previous purchases.</p>

        <h3>2. Grocery Stores</h3>
        <p>Supermarkets analyze shopping patterns to strategically place products. If customers frequently buy milk and cereal together, placing them near each other can boost sales.</p>

        <h3>3. Fraud Detection</h3>
        <p>Banks and financial institutions apply MBA to detect unusual transaction patterns that indicate fraudulent activity.</p>

        <h3>4. Healthcare</h3>
        <p>Hospitals analyze patient records to find relationships between symptoms, diseases, and treatments, leading to improved medical decision-making.</p>

        <h3>5. Online Streaming and Content Recommendations</h3>
        <p>Streaming platforms like Netflix and Spotify use MBA to recommend movies, TV shows, and songs based on users' past interactions.</p>
