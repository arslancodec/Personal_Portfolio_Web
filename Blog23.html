      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Clustering is an essential unsupervised learning technique used in machine learning and data mining to group similar data points together. It helps in discovering hidden patterns and structures in datasets without predefined labels.</p>

        <h2>What is Clustering?</h2>
        <p>Clustering is the process of dividing a dataset into groups, called clusters, based on similarity. Each cluster contains data points that share common characteristics, making it easier to analyze and interpret data.</p>

        <h2>Popular Clustering Techniques</h2>

        <h3>1. K-Means Clustering</h3>
        <p>A widely used algorithm that partitions data into K clusters by minimizing the distance between data points and the cluster centroids.</p>

        <h3>2. Hierarchical Clustering</h3>
        <p>Builds a hierarchy of clusters using either agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down) approaches.</p>

        <h3>3. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)</h3>
        <p>A density-based clustering method that identifies clusters based on the density of data points, useful for detecting clusters of varying shapes.</p>

        <h3>4. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)</h3>
        <p>A probabilistic model that assumes data is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions.</p>

        <h3>5. Mean Shift Clustering</h3>
        <p>An algorithm that iteratively moves data points toward the mode (highest density region) to form clusters.</p>

        <h2>Applications of Clustering</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Customer Segmentation:</strong> Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior.</li>
          <li><strong>Anomaly Detection:</strong> Identifying fraudulent transactions or network intrusions.</li>
          <li><strong>Image Segmentation:</strong> Dividing images into meaningful regions.</li>
          <li><strong>Recommendation Systems:</strong> Clustering similar users for personalized recommendations.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Clustering is a powerful technique for uncovering patterns in unlabeled data. With various clustering methods available, choosing the right approach depends on the dataset, the number of clusters needed, and the desired application.</p>
