      <p><strong>Published on:</strong> January 28, 2025</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Decision Trees are one of the most widely used algorithms for classification tasks. They offer a simple yet effective way to model decision-making processes by splitting data based on feature values.</p>

        <h2>What is a Decision Tree?</h2>
        <p>A Decision Tree is a tree-like structure where internal nodes represent decision points based on features, branches represent possible outcomes, and leaf nodes represent class labels.</p>

        <h2>How Decision Trees Work</h2>

        <h3>1. Selecting the Best Feature</h3>
        <p>The model chooses the most significant feature to split the data. This selection is based on criteria such as Gini impurity or Information Gain.</p>

        <h3>2. Splitting the Data</h3>
        <p>The dataset is divided based on feature values. Each subset is further split until a stopping condition is met.</p>

        <h3>3. Assigning Class Labels</h3>
        <p>Once the tree reaches a leaf node, it assigns a class label based on the majority class in that subset.</p>

        <h2>Key Concepts in Decision Trees</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Gini Impurity</h3>
        <p>Measures how often a randomly chosen element would be incorrectly classified.</p>

        <h3>2. Information Gain</h3>
        <p>Determines how much a feature improves classification performance.</p>

        <h3>3. Overfitting</h3>
        <p>Occurs when the tree becomes too complex, capturing noise instead of patterns.</p>

        <h3>4. Pruning</h3>
        <p>Reduces the complexity of the tree by removing less important branches.</p>

        <h2>Advantages of Decision Trees</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Easy to interpret and visualize.</li>
          <li>Requires minimal data preprocessing.</li>
          <li>Handles both numerical and categorical data.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Limitations of Decision Trees</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Prone to overfitting if not properly pruned.</li>
          <li>Can be unstable with small variations in data.</li>
          <li>Less effective for complex datasets compared to ensemble methods.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Decision Trees are a fundamental machine learning technique for classification. Understanding their working principles, advantages, and limitations helps in building more effective models.</p>
