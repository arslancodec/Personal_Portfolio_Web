      <h1>K-Means Clustering Explained: Concepts and Applications</h1>
      <p><strong>Published on:</strong> January 28, 2025</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>K-Means clustering is one of the most widely used unsupervised learning algorithms for partitioning datasets into distinct clusters. It is simple, efficient, and applicable to various real-world scenarios.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>What is K-Means Clustering?</h2>
        <p>K-Means is an iterative clustering algorithm that partitions data into K clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster. Each cluster is defined by its centroid, and data points are assigned to the nearest centroid.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>How K-Means Works</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Choose K:</strong> Select the number of clusters.</li>
          <li><strong>Initialize Centroids:</strong> Randomly place K centroids in the dataset.</li>
          <li><strong>Assign Data Points:</strong> Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.</li>
          <li><strong>Update Centroids:</strong> Compute the mean of all points in each cluster and move the centroid to this new location.</li>
          <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Continue steps 3 and 4 until the centroids stop changing or a maximum number of iterations is reached.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Choosing the Optimal K</h2>
        <p>The number of clusters (K) significantly impacts the quality of clustering. The <strong>Elbow Method</strong> and the <strong>Silhouette Score</strong> are commonly used techniques to determine the best K value.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Applications of K-Means Clustering</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Customer Segmentation:</strong> Grouping customers based on purchase behavior.</li>
          <li><strong>Image Compression:</strong> Reducing colors in an image by clustering pixel values.</li>
          <li><strong>Document Clustering:</strong> Organizing documents into topic-based groups.</li>
          <li><strong>Market Research:</strong> Identifying patterns in consumer behavior.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Advantages and Limitations</h2>
        
        <h3>Advantages:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Simple and easy to implement.</li>
          <li>Scales well to large datasets.</li>
          <li>Efficient in terms of computation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Limitations:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Requires choosing the number of clusters (K) in advance.</li>
          <li>Sensitive to outliers and noisy data.</li>
          <li>May converge to a local optimum depending on initial centroid placement.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>K-Means clustering is a powerful and widely used technique in machine learning. By understanding its working principles, applications, and limitations, data scientists can effectively apply it to real-world problems.</p>
